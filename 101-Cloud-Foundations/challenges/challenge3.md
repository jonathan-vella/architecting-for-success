# Architecting for Success

## Strategy and Plan workshop

## Challenge 3 - Time to Plan (1hr 15mins)

This challenge's focus is to convert the aspirational goals of the cloud adoption strategy into an actionable plan. You will use the cloud adoption plan to guide technical efforts and align them with Contoso's business strategy.

Contoso is expecting you to present a high-level financial assessment. Your team will need to create an Azure Migrate assessment to gain an understanding of what the estimated costs would look like post-migration. You will need to use this [pre-populated Excel file](./../docs/Azure%20Migrate%20import%20template%20-%20Migration%20VF.csv); it contains information about Contoso’s current digital estate. Spend some time reviewing the contents of the file and the results of the Azure Migrate assessment. The final assessment will contribute to the team’s business case.

**Learning objectives:**

- Take an inventory of a customer's digital estate & understand cloud costs.
- Get more familiar with the five Rs of rationalization which is the process of evaluating assets to determine the best way to migrate or modernize each asset in the cloud.
- Understand that a readiness plan will enable agile employees to explore and learn new cloud technologies instead of fearing them. These employees can lead the adoption of cloud services and help the organization learn and embrace the associated changes.
- The value of having a process and approach for planning and tracking the completion of cloud adoption projects.

## Challenge 3 – Success Criteria

1. Remember that this is a litmus test. The use of reference documentation is perfectly acceptable.
2. Create an assessment report including cost estimates using the Azure Migrate tool.
3. Create a high-level workload rationalization plan which is de-risked by using cloud adoption horizons.
4. Create a readiness plan which maps roles and skills.
5. Translate strategy and effort into an actionable cloud adoption plan. This plan should clearly demonstrate that you have a process and approach for planning and tracking the completion of cloud adoption projects.
