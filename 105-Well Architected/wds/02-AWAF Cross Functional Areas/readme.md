## Customer recommendations analysis

**Objective**

By the end of this unit, you will be able to: 
* Outline customer needs, business priorities, and key architectural characteristics given a realistic customer workload.
* Conduct a cross-pillar analysis and determine key gaps in the workload's alignment with the Well-Architected Framework.

**Overview**

Now that you've explored the scenario, you'll complete an analysis focused on identifying recommendations. To do this, your team will complete a whiteboarding session on a series of topics, each focused on a key cross-functional area.  

The goal of this session is to ensure that the solutions your team develops are holistic, encompassing all necessary components of a Well-Architected Framework. It's also important to maintain a focus on interoperability, being sure that your solutions function well together and impact your customer's goals and objectives.

After completing the whiteboard, you'll also complete a discussion activity to help you identify key themes and important takeaways from your whiteboard session before moving on to the prioritization phase of today's workshop.

**Total Duration**: 2.5hours
