**Objective**

By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:
* Practice proactive customer conversations around the Well-Architected Framework.

**Team lead guidance**

Be prepared to facilitate the activity as needed and assign a speaking order to your team members.

**Overview**

All team members must participate in the team presentation and should work together to assign roles and responsibilities and provide each other with feedback during the practice session.

**Duration**: 15 minutes per team

**Participant guidance**

For this exercise, your team will present your findings to the coach and receive feedback. Use the observation chart with all the required notes that was created during the workshop to present the solution and receive feedback.

The coach will act as a customer.

**Participant steps**

1. Go back to the Team channel and verify that all team members are present.
2. Time is limited. Assign an observer who will keep track of the customer conversations and feedback sessions and ensure that all teams stay within the timeframes (ten minutes for each conversation presentation and five minutes for feedback).
3. Deliver customer conversations (in pairs) to the team.
   * [Pair 1: 10-minute customer conversation. Pairs 2, 3, and 4: listen + 5-minute feedback.]  
   * [Pair 2: 10-minute customer conversation. Pairs 1, 3 and 4: listen + 5-minute feedback.]  
   * [Pair 3: 10-minute customer conversation. Pairs 1, 2 and 4: listen + 5-minute feedback.]  
   * [Pair 4: 10-minute customer conversation. Pairs 1, 2 and 3: listen + 5-minute feedback.]
4. Team members should provide feedback to each participant and should include:
   * One thing that each presenter did well.
   * One thing that the pair could improve upon for a more effective customer conversation.
