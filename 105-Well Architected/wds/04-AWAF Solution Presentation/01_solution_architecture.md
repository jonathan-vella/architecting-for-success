## Customer Solution Architecture Presentation

**Objective**
By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:
* Practice proactive customer conversations around the Well-Architected Framework.

**Team lead guidance**

* Explain that team members will now practice presenting the recommendations developed by the team in the previous activity.
* All team members must participate in the team presentation and should work together to assign roles and responsibilities and provide each other with feedback during the practice session.  
* Set the time for when the team members need to conclude the discussion.
* Instruct the team to each choose one of the cross-functional areas to present. Some people may need to present more than one area if you do not have at least five people on your team.

**Overview**

Your team will now practice as if you were delivering a pitch to the customer. The findings and recommendations for each cross-functional area should be presented by one of the team members. One person should also take on the role of wrapping up and summarizing the recommendations in a holistic way.

**Duration:** 1hr 15minutes

**Participant guidance**

Being a Solutions Architect means being responsible for the design and implementation of technical solutions that meet the requirements of a business goal or project. Your solution should be based on the customer's needs and priorities. You should also consider the customer's budget and timeline.

Use the **observation chart** with all the required notes that were created during the workshop to design one more solution architectures.
Use a **storytelling strategy** to present the solution to your customer. Remember that in real life, the customer might not understand technical vocabulary. Clients may not know how a technical solution looks or how it should be presented.
Identify the **architecture style**: The first step is to identify the architecture style that suits your requirements. It could be a microservices architecture, a more traditional N-tier application, or a big data solution.
Choose the **main technology pieces**: Once you have identified the architecture style, you can start choosing the main technology pieces for the architecture. For example, if you are building a microservices architecture, you might choose to use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for hosting the microservices, Azure Cosmos DB for the database, and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for authentication and authorization.
Design for **scalability and resilience**: Applications should be designed to scale horizontally, adding new instances as demand requires. They should also be resilient when failures occur. For example, if a microservice fails, the application should be able to continue to function without that microservice.
**Automate deployments**: Deployments must be automated and predictable. This is especially important for cloud applications, where you might need to deploy to multiple environments, such as development, test, and production.
**Monitor and gain insights**: Monitoring and telemetry are critical for gaining insight into the system. You should be able to monitor the health of the system and individual components, and you should be able to gain insights into how the system is being used.
**Refer to Azure Architecture Center**: Microsoft provides an Azure Architecture Center that offers architecture diagrams and technology descriptions for reference architectures, real-world examples of cloud architectures, and solution ideas for common workloads on Azure ³. The center also provides a guide for Azure Application Architecture that covers architecture styles for cloud applications, technology choices, design principles, the five pillars of software quality, and cloud design patterns.

**Participant steps**

1. Choose your desired topic and take a couple of minutes to prepare your presentation.
2. All team members will take turns presenting their topics. Plan to speak for about two to three minutes.
3. Listen to your teammates' presentations.
4. Provide each other with constructive feedback and coaching.

**Tips**

The solution designs can be high-level design diagrams. Functional requirements are not in scope of this exercise, but non-functional requirements should be considered and documented.

**Activity summary**

Now that you created one or more solution designs, it is time to put everything into a presentation and practice your presentation with your team.
