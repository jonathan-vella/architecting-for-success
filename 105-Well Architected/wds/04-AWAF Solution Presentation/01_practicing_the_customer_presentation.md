## Customer Solution Presentation

**Objective**
By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:
* Practice proactive customer conversations around the Well-Architected Framework.

**Team lead guidance**

* Explain that team members will now practice presenting the recommendations developed by the team in the previous activity.
* All team members must participate in the team presentation and should work together to assign roles and responsibilities and provide each other with feedback during the practice session.  
* Set the time for when the team members need to conclude the discussion.
* Instruct the team to each choose one of the cross-functional areas to present. Some people may need to present more than one area if you do not have at least five people on your team.

**Overview**

Your team will now practice as if you were delivering a pitch to the customer. The findings and recommendations for each cross-functional area should be presented by one of the team members. One person should also take on the role of wrapping up and summarizing the recommendations in a holistic way.

**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Participant guidance**

1. Use the observation chart with all the required notes that was created during the workshop to present the solution to the customer.
2. Use a storytelling strategy to present the solution to your customer. Remember that in real life, the customer might not understand technical vocabulary. Clients may not know how a technical solution looks or how it should be presented.
3. Create a brief story that the customer can relate to their needs. Initiate the presentation with a real customer problem and how it will be solved.
4. Consider the following questions to guide your conversations as needed:
   * What are the customer's pain points, challenges, and business goals?
   * How should we structure our presentation to convey the value of our recommendations?
   * Outlined solution
   * What do successful solutions look like for the customer?
5. Areas of improvement
   * What questions is the customer most likely to ask?
   * What are common objections the customer may present?
   * How would you approach the client and present the solution?
   * Which information can you use from the available resources?

Participant steps

1. Choose your desired topic and take a couple of minutes to prepare your presentation.
2. All team members will take turns presenting their topics. Plan to speak for about two to three minutes.
3. Listen to your teammates' presentations.
4. Provide each other with constructive feedback and coaching.

**Tips**

The customer conversation does not need to include a summary of customer needs or priorities.

**Activity summary**

Now that you have practiced your presentation with your team, you are ready to present to your coach for feedback.
