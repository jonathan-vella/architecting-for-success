# Architecting for Success

## 105 - Azure Well Architected Workshop

### Workshop Introduction

The Well-Architected Framework (WAF) mindset focuses on overall workload health, highlighting the full picture of the customer's architecture, and the importance of an iterative, five-pillar approach.​ Working within a Well-Architected Framework requires a shift away from narrow, siloed solutions and toward holistic, integrative approaches to solving a customer's infrastructure as a service (IaaS) challenges. At the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

* Outline customer needs, business priorities, and key architectural characteristics given a realistic customer workload.
* Conduct a cross-pillar analysis and determine key gaps in the workload's alignment with the Well-Architected Framework.
* Develop a prioritized list of recommendations and next steps.
* Practice proactive customer conversations around the Well-Architected Framework.

### Basics of the Well-Architected Framework

Employing a Well-Architected Framework begins with understanding the five-pillar approach, which acknowledges that any high-functioning framework addresses the following areas:

* Reliability - The ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function.
* Security - Protecting applications and data from threats.
* Cost optimization - Managing costs to maximize the value delivered.
* Operational excellence - Operations processes that keep a system running in production.
* Performance efficiency - The ability of a system to adapt to changes in load.

The strategic and long-term viability of the workload requires an end-to-end, holistic review spanning all five pillars.

### Cross-functional areas

Our customers do not think of their needs and goals in terms of pillars. Rather, they seek to accomplish cross-functional goals to meet their business objectives. In this workshop, we'll review a customer scenario and identify solutions for five common cross-functional areas of focus:

* Resiliency - Analyze how business continuity and disaster recovery requirements are being addressed by the workload architecture and operational strategies.
* Performance and Scale - Analyze the performance and scalability requirements within the workload architecture; evaluate how they contribute to and/or are affected by the overall fault tolerance of the workload.
* Security, Governance & Identity - Analyze how security, governance, and identity requirements are being addressed by the workload architecture and operational strategies.
* DevOps - Analyze the automation and deployment strategies for the workload.
* Observability - Analyze how observability requirements are being addressed by the workload architecture and operational strategies.

### An iterative approach

It's also important to recognize that implementing a Well-Architected Framework requires an iterative approach, as described in the workflow diagram.

This 2-day workshop is primarily focused on phases one, two, and three, in which you Discover the customer's needs, Analyze to identify potential solutions, and Prioritize—or conduct triage to determine what needs to be implemented first. We will also discuss the optimization that occurs post-implementation to further enhance and refine the customer's architecture.
