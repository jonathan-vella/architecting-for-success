# Welcome to the _Secure Networking_ hackathon

Hello and welcome to the Secure-Networking hackathon, a challenge-oriented hack event from Microsoft. You will be presented with a series of challenges, each one more difficult than the one before.

During this hack your team will focus on designing and implementing networking solutions in Azure that meet the demanding needs of today’s global enterprise organizations. You will analyze the customers’ on-premises environment and design a secure networking solution for their workloads as they are migrated to Azure.

At the end of the hack, you will be able to design and deploy a scalable network architecture on Azure and securely connect Azure workloads to on-premises and external environments. You will know how to identify potential networking design pitfalls, how to architect and implement networking solutions to improve workload performance, scalability, and security in Azure. You will be able to identify multiple design solutions and evaluate which solution is best for the presented scenario.
