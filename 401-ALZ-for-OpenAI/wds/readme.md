## Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution

**Outcome**
Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 30-minute chalk-talk format.

Timeframe: 120 minutes

Sarah is asking you to design a solution that addresses her concerns. She wants to avoid the risks that she has identified as much as possible so that InnovateWearâ€™s AI journey is a success.

Your solution must be based on a governance-driven approach, and must include all of the following:

1. An Azure Landing Zone architecture design which is tailored to meet Sarah's business requirements.
2. A high-level architecture diagram of Azure OpenAI Services and all other supporting services.
3. A network architecture design which is secure and resilient.
4. A list of the required Azure Policy policies or initiatives including scope assignments.

When designing your solution, consider the following:

- How will you implement Sarah's data sovereignty requirements?
- Besides Azure OpenAI, which other Azure services can Sarah leverage to meet her business needs?
- How can you leverage the zero-trust security model to protect Sarah's data?
- How can you help Sarah's business stay connected to Azure OpenAI Services? Note that Sarah wants to:
  - Have Azure OpenAI services connect to private data sources in Azure and on-premises using a plug & play approach
  - Securely expose the chatbot to the internet
- Resiliency and high availability are important to Sarah. How can you help Sarah's business achieve this?
- How can you mitigate the risk of cost overruns?
- How can you help Sarah's business scale up as it grows?
- How can you help Sarah's business avoid issues related to scalability, performance, and compliance?
- Sarah's determined that governance is a must-have, however she wants to avoid governance becoming a bottleneck. How can you help Sarah's business achieve this?
- Time-to-market is important to Sarah. If you had to build a prototype to demonstrate the solution, how long would it take?
