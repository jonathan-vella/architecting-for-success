# Deny the use of non-allowed VMs based on SKU

This policy can deny the use of non-allowed VM SKUs such as M-Series and N-Series. This policy, combined with other policies which for example deny the use of Azure Machines Learning Services, can help mitigate the risk and impact of cryptojacking.

> Note: By default this policy is configure with a "deny" effect; this will not impact any existing resources. Other allowed values are "Audit" and "Disabled".

To import this policy you can either use the Azure Portal and copy & paste the content of "policy-name.json" into a new policy definition, or via Powershell:
```powershell
New-AzPolicyDefinition -Name "My Policy Name" -ManagementGroupName "My Mgmt Group" -Policy "policy.json"
```
The command creates a policy definition named "My Policy Name" in the Management Group "My Mgmt Group" using the "policy.json" file. For more information about other parameters that you can use, see [New-AzPolicyDefinition](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azpolicydefinition).

When called without location parameters, New-AzPolicyDefinition defaults to saving the policy definition in the selected subscription of the sessions context. To save the definition to a different location, use the following parameters:

- SubscriptionId - Save to a different subscription. Requires a GUID value.
- ManagementGroupName - Save to a management group. Requires a string value.

My recommendation is to save the policy definition in a management group and assign the policy either to this same management group or to another management group further down your hierarchy.

> Note: If you apply any access or policy at one level in the hierarchy, it propagates down to the lower levels. If you apply this policy at a management group level, the subscription owner can't alter an inherited policy. This limitation helps improve governance.
