# Architecting for Success: AI-Ready Azure Landing Zones

---

## Challenge 06 - Azure Design Review (30mins)

In this challenge you will be doing an Azure design review to double-check that you are following best practices, or perhaps to evaluate the work of others.

You will be using this [repo](https://github.com/Azure/review-checklists) which contains code and examples to operationalize spreadsheet-based checklists that can be used for Azure design reviews on multiple technologies.

## Challenge 06 - Success Criteria

1. Use the Excel spreadsheet, import the latest Azure Landing Zone checklist, and explore the contents of the file.
2. Review all checklist items with a "high" severity. Share your findings with your coach.
3. Use the provided workbooks to dynamically verify whether the resources in your subscription(s) are compliant with the checklist recommendations.
