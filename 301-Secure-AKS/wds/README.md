Contoso Payment Services Ltd. is a multinational corporation, headquartered in Europe that provides payment services solutions. They have data centres and branch offices scattered across Europe.

Consoso seeks to maximize the cost-effectiveness and flexibility of its IT, especially in new projects. Contoso has a large number of business units, each with its own unique IT requirements. The costs of internal hardware and data centre investment are ballooning. As a result, Contoso has decided to move their current workloads to the cloud and all future developments should follow a cloud native approach.

They are interested in a large-scale solution that will help mitigate creeping costs and start the transition to a modern cloud-based enterprise architecture.

Their workloads should be fully compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DDS). Contoso must evaluate their environment for compliance gaps with respect to moving to Azure. 

In this whiteboard design session, you will learn how to design an Enterprise Kubernetes Regulated Cluster architecture for Contoso. You will be working through the customer scenario and their particular requirements to produce a tailored architecture for their deployment.

## Student Guide

In this whiteboard design session, you will learn how to design an Enterprise Kubernetes Regulated Cluster architecture for Contoso. You will be working through the customer scenario and their particular requirements to produce a tailored architecture for their deployment.

This session will help you consider the baseline requirements of a regulated cluster and guide you on how to run sensitive workloads in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.
