## Customer situation

Contoso Payment Services Ltd. is a multinational corporation, headquartered in Europe that provides payment services solutions. They have data centres and branch offices scattered across Europe.

Consoso seeks to maximize the cost-effectiveness and flexibility of its IT, especially in new projects. Contoso has a large number of business units, each with its own unique IT requirements. The costs of internal hardware and data centre investment are ballooning. As a result, Contoso has decided to move their current workloads to the cloud and all future developments should follow a cloud native approach.

They are interested in a large-scale solution that will help mitigate creeping costs and start the transition to a modern cloud-based enterprise architecture.

Their workloads should be fully compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Contoso must evaluate their environment for compliance gaps with respect to moving to Azure. 

In addition to the PCI DSS compliance requirements, they are expecting significant growth. They foresee the need to scale their system and are exploring moving their web applications, corporate and data collection web apps, to Microsoft Azure via lift and shift and other applicable methods to simplify some of the operations management overhead and associated costs. They would also like to ensure that the workloads of different business units are sufficiently isolated. Lastly, they want to ensure that resources are created using best practices and that those practices are followed during the resource provisioning process.

The CTO, is aware of the cloud potentials, but also has a keen understanding that without strong governance, they may end up with an environment that lacks essential business controls. These incorrect practices can then be disbursed across the enterprise, leading to an unmanageable Azure estate and costs which are hard to track or control. He wants to start on the right foot by enforcing best practices from the start.

To kick off planning for integrating Azure into their environment, the CTO introduced you to several directors within the Enterprise IT group that have been part of the initial Azure planning process.

Enterprise IT is responsible for managing corporate network connectivity, datacentre distribution, capacity planning, identity, enterprise wide SaaS services, supporting services and audit policies.

To help drive Azure adoption and best practices, the CTO chartered a Cloud Governance team within Enterprise IT. This team will be responsible for all aspects of Azure governance. This includes defining, implementing and enforcing cloud governance and working with other teams to ensure best practices are adopted.

Rather than re-invent the wheel, the Cloud Governance team decided to adopt Microsoft's Cloud Adoption Framework as a baseline upon which they will build their governance implementation.

The Cloud Governance team is in the process of finalizing the actionable plan for their cloud adoption strategy. The plan will guide their technical efforts and be in full alignment of their business strategy.

The best approach for migrating to the cloud, based on their digital estate is to utilize Azure Kubernetes Services as the orchestrator for hosting their stateless applications. The majority of their applications are containerized.

## Customer needs

### Security

1. AKS cluster should not have any public IP addresses.
2. Limit access of AKS cluster from an internal network, and continue to support VPN access.
3. Incoming traffic and traffic between application components should be encrypted with TLS
4. Make sure that pods from different namespaces cannot communicate with each other
5. Make sure that the services pods (APIs) can only be accessed by the front end pods or the ingress controller pods.
6. Ability to scale automatically as the company grows and system load increases.
7. Use private container registry with support of container image scanning.
8. Sensitive parameters should not be stored in the Kubernetes cluster, but in a secret store.
9. Application workloads should be separated from control plane workloads.
10. Ability to use ingress controller that does not consume compute power from the cluster.
11. Protect all your web apps from common web-hacking techniques such as SQL injection and security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting.
12. Control and secure the outbound traffic.
13. Continuously assess AKS cluster to provide visibility into misconfigurations and guidelines to help mitigate identified threats.
14. Use cluster and nodes threat protection by generating security alerts for suspicious activities.

### Governance

1. Continually review and assign legal compliance tasks and provide a compliance reporting ability for Azure resources.
2. Enforce cluster pod security restricted standards for Linux-based workloads.
3. Enforce cluster pod security baseline standards for Linux-based workloads.
4. Use images from trusted registries to reduce the Kubernetes cluster's exposure risk to unknown vulnerabilities, security issues and malicious images.
5. Ensure that no Load Balancer services with a public IP address can be created in the Kubernetes cluster.
6. Ensure that access to the application over the ingress controller is encrypted with SSL.

### Observability

1. Enable logging across all components to support an all-encompassing monitoring solution.
2. Provide tooling to help them with monitoring and managing container health and security.
3. Display cluster metrics graphically.
4. Enhance the logged data from the application to give the developers a more complete picture of the application's performance and behavior.
5. Implement proactive diagnostics to generate automatic alerts for unusual application behavior including unusual request response time, dependency response time, and page load time.

### Scalability

1. The cluster should auto scale based on demand.
2. Control pod scaling on resource utilization.

### Identity and Access Control

1. Ensure that Azure admins utilize best practices when accessing the Azure resources and that all logins are logged for identity theft analysis activities.
2. Kubernetes administrators must authenticate to the cluster using their AAD credentials.
3. Kubernetes authorization on resource level (i.e namespace) should be managed through an Identity provider.

### Operations

1. Be able to test functionality before pushing it to production systems.
2. Be able to automatically and continuously deploy new software builds.
3. Ensure that continuously deployed builds to the cloud do not interfere with the production system.
4. Use pull based approach to reconcile configuration changes without exposing cluster endpoints to the build agents.
5. Keep Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) nodes up to date with the latest security patches or supported Kubernetes versions.

### Business Continuity

1. Ensure that the workloads remains functional in case of Data Centre failure.
2. Kubernetes API Server should have a guarantee uptime of 99.95%
3. Ability but not a hard requirement to failover to another region in case of disaster.
4. Spin-off a new cluster including all the configuration easily.
5. Backup strategy for Kubernetes resources and persistent volumes.
