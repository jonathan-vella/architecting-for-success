## A Well-Architected Framework cross-functional areas analysis

**Overview**

This unit contains a five-part whiteboarding exercise focused on key cross-functional areas within a Well-Architected Framework. After completing this exercise, you'll then wrap up with a team discussion to summarize the themes and key takeaways from your brainstorming.

**Objective**

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:

* Outline customer needs, business priorities, and key architectural characteristics given a realistic customer workload.
* Conduct a cross-pillar analysis and determine key gaps in the workload's alignment with the Well-Architected Framework.

**Participant guidance**

In this phase, **get all your ideas down on paper**. Once you've completed the whiteboarding session, your team will work together to refine and prioritize your recommendations.

**Team lead guidance**

* This whiteboard will be completed collaboratively using the [provided table](./02_whiteboard_table.md).
* Encourage all members to brainstorm and share their ideas on how to make the current architecture more resilient.
* You may choose to start the discussion by level-setting with your team on the basics of resiliency by reviewing the provided resources.
* Assign a timekeeper so your team gets through all of the topics before the end of the session.
