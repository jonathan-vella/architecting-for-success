* Encourage all members to share their ideas.

**Activity Overview**

In this whiteboard activity, brainstorm with your team about best practices for refining and optimizing a Well-Architected Framework. The goal of this session is to document a list of strategies that you can use as a follow-up strategy with customers.

**Duration**: 15 minutes

**Participant guidance**

* After proposing a solution to your customer, we will need to ensure this solution was implemented and it is properly working to remediate customer needs.  
* The goal of this whiteboard activity is to establish a list of steps and actions to follow up on with your customer, to be certain that they are actually remediating their workload.
* Consider the following questions, share ideas and use your experience around refining and optimizing:
  * What are best practices for assessing the success of a workload?
  * What are the right steps to help our customer to remediate the workload?
  * What questions do you ask? What metrics should be considered?
  * How do you determine the next steps to be accomplished for success?
  * How do we determine the consequent customer follow-up?  
* Share ideas and experiences you've had refining and optimizing a customer solution.
* Document your suggestions and step list if needed, and consider that in the future, this step list can serve as a guide for you to follow up with your customers.
