## Developing a prioritized list of recommendations

**Objective**

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
• Develop a prioritized list of recommendations and next steps.

Team lead guidance
• Assign a timekeeper and instruct them to provide a warning when time is running out.
• Encourage all members to share their ideas.

**Overview**

Participants will engage in a team exercise to refine their list of potential solutions by prioritizing for impact and alignment with the customer's business objectives. They will also complete an observation chart summarizing their recommendations to prepare for the customer presentation.

**Duration**: 15 minutes

**Participant guidance**

In this exercise, participants will assess priorities to create an actionable plan using the observation chart. Consider the following questions to draft your solution:

Findings/requirements
* What are the most important recommendations?
* Are those recommendations immediately actionable?

Issues identified
* What are the biggest concerns for the customer?  
* Are the recommendations aligned with the business objectives?
* Do you have an architecture diagram for the mid- and long-term proposals?

Recommendations for taking action
* What customer needs should be prioritized, maintaining a WAF five-pillars holistic perspective?
* How will you measure the success of the recommendations?

When you are assigning priority to an action step, you should determine whether it is:

- P0 – Critical short-term
- P1 – Strongly recommended mid-term
- P2 – Long-term sustainability

**Participant steps**

1. In this exercise, discuss the provided questions with your team.
2. Use the results of your brainstorming sessions to complete the observation chart, assigning a level of priority to each solution.

**Tips**

Keep in mind that some goals will have to be met in phases and that certain solutions rely on other improvements being in place first. Keep the long-term vision in mind while considering what is immediately useful and actionable.

**Summary**

In this exercise, participants refined their ideas, identifying the most urgent and actionable solutions, while also considering the long-term plan for the customer's architecture.
