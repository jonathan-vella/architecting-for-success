# 102 - Azure Landing Zones

## Overview

Successful cloud adoption is built on the strong foundations of the Cloud Adoption Framework Ready methodology. But what the hack is an Azure landing zone?

Simply put, a landing zone is a multi-subscription Azure environment for hosting workloads, pre-provisioned through code. Out-of-the-box it accounts for scale, security, governance, networking, and identity. It  enables application migration, modernization, and innovation at enterprise-scale for all customers irrespective of size in Azure. This approach considers all platform resources that are required to support the customer's application portfolio and doesn't differentiate between infrastructure as a service or platform as a service.

# About this module

In this module, you will learn how to **make design decisions and deploy the Azure landing zone conceptual architecture** using either the Azure Portal experience or the Bicep Accelerator. You will get familiar with the design areas and design principles of Azure Landing Zones. At the end of this module, you will be able to understand how to leverage the existing reference implementations as well as how to establish policy-driven governance.
