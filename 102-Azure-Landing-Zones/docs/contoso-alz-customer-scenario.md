### Technical details

- Contoso operates a traditional hybrid data center (DC) environment, comprising physical, virtual servers and Azure virtual machines.
- Their infrastructure includes a mix of Windows and Linux servers, some of which run legacy applications.
- Workloads are hosted on VMware vSphere, with primary sites in Athens (Production DC) and Thessaloniki (Disaster Recovery DC).
- The environment consists of approximately 75 VMs for production, fewer than 20 for development and testing, and around 20TB of data from various sources.
- Several VMs run SAP HANA, utilizing a total of 4TB of RAM and 100TB of storage. The SAP landscape includes primary and secondary application servers, primary and secondary database servers, and a file server, all of which are critical and require high availability and disaster recovery.
- A site-to-site (S2S) connection links the on-premises DC in Athens to Azure.
- A payment service, compliant with PCI-DSS, is hosted on Azure VMs.
- The CRM system, used by both SAP and the payment service, runs on SQL Server 2019 Enterprise Edition. There have been ongoing performance issues between the payment service and the CRM system.
- An MPLS connection exists between DCs, with some warehouses and distribution centers serving as internet breakout points.
- Microsoft 365 services are in use, though there are gaps in the identity security posture.
- Two Azure subscriptions are utilized: one for production workloads and another for a developer sandbox connected to the production network.
- The on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain is synchronized with Entra ID.
- The network team has expertise in Cisco, Checkpoint, and F5 technologies.
- There is limited expertise and experience with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and DevOps practices.
- A dedicated 10.0.0.0/16 IP address space is allocated for Azure networks.

### Requirements

- Migrate the SAP production landscape to Azure within 6 weeks.
- Optimize the performance of the payment service when reading records from the CRM system.
- Block the ability to create resources outside of the EU.
- Identify existing Azure resources which are not zone resilient.
- Easily generate cost-related reports for each workload and application based on department and environment.
- Implement a cost avoidance solution which will restrict the use of M-Series VMs and Machine Learning services.
- Minimize on-premises footprint and replace MPLS with a cloud-based approach. Enable local internet breakout from all sites to improve SaaS application performance and reduce WAN load.
- Separate Production, Staging, and Development environments with restricted communication between them.
- Enforce the filtering of network traffic between Azure resources in an Azure virtual network.
- Backup all production VMs and selected VMs in dev & test environments.
- Implement built-in platform regulatory compliance security checks and reporting for all production environment (PCI-DSS and GDPR).
- Implement observability of all resources across all environments with minimal effort.
- Restrict Public IP Addresses to core network functionality only.
- Receive cost-related alerts for abnormal consumption, cost overruns,  etc.
- Receive alerts related to the health, performance, and security of all platform resources.
